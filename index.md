# Butler Databases for Community Science Users at the RSP

```{abstract}
Describes the database infrastructure that supports end-user access to Butler metadata via the Rubin Science Platform.
```

## Scope


Not included in this document are:
* Butler databases used internally by the project team
* Butler databases hosted by other institutions (which may contain the same data as the databases described here.)
* The filesystem containing the image data ("datastore" in Butler jargon)

## Taxonomy of Butler databases

### Database access method

There are two primary methods of accessing Butler metadata, shown in the table
below.  These two access methods use two different database schemas.

| Access Method | Schema |
| ------------- | ------ |
| Butler library | Butler Registry |
| IVOA TAP service | ObsCore |

Confusingly, these two schemas sometimes co-exist in the same database and
sometimes are deployed separately.  Some considerations for how these databases
are configured for each deployment are described below.


#### Registry (supports Butler library)

The [Registry schema](https://dmtn-073.lsst.io/) supports access to Butler data
via the [Butler library](https://github.com/lsst/daf_butler) and [pipelines
framework](https://dmtn-229.lsst.io/).  It tracks the location of data files
generated by the telescope and science pipelines, along with metadata allowing
searches for files of interest.

A Registry database can be hosted using either Postgres or SQLite.  Large-scale
shared repositories are hosted using Postgres, while SQLite is used for smaller
personal repositories.

#### ObsCore (supports TAP)

ObsCore is an [IVOA standard](https://www.ivoa.net/documents/ObsCore/) defining
a set of observation metadata and a protocol for accessing it.  The metadata
for some Butler dataset types in the Registry can be presented as an ObsCore
table.

We currently have two ways to host ObsCore data derived from Butler metadata:
* Loaded into [QServ](https://dmtn-243.lsst.io/) alongside the LSST catalogs.
* Co-located in the same Postgres database as the Butler Registry, in a separate table.

In both of these cases, end users access the data via a [TAP
service](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/lsst-tap-service), [hosted in the Rubin
Science Platform](https://phalanx.lsst.io/applications/tap/index.html).

##### QServ

ObsCore via QServ is used for the annual data releases, because QServ provides
a spatially partitioned, scalable cluster of database instances.  When the data
release is made, [a script](https://github.com/lsst-dm/dax_obscore) is used to
convert metadata from the Butler Registry database into a format that can be
ingested by QServ.

QServ is not well-suited for dynamically updated data, so this setup is only
used for static data releases.

##### Co-located with Registry DB

The ObsCore table can also be hosted in Postgres, sharing a database with the
Butler Registry.  The Butler library can be configured with an ["ObsCore
Manager"](https://github.com/lsst/daf_butler/blob/50c0a9ef673d2b360f76026ea5d13829836f77b2/python/lsst/daf/butler/registry/obscore/_manager.py#L115)
that maintains an ObsCore table containing information about datasets in the
Registry.  As datasets are added through the usual Butler methods for updating
the Registry, the ObsCore table is updated simultaneously.


### Update modes

Different Butler repositories are updated at different cadences.  This affects:
* How data is loaded into the database
* How aggressively data can be cached by consumers
* Which databases can be used

Repositories may be entirely static, batch updated on a regular schedule, or
updated continuously as changes are made.

#### Static

Data releases are generated in full prior to their release to the public, and
are not changed after they are created.  This allows flexibility in hosting
their databases, because a separate public-facing database can be created by
bulk-loading a copy of the data.

For these databases, the Registry data will be hosted in Postgres via Google
Cloud SQL at the IDF. ObsCore data will be hosted in QServ at the USDF.

Because the data is not changed after it is deployed, Butler server can
aggressively cache frequently used tables and we can deploy multiple read
replicas to scale the database load.

See [below](#dp1) for more information about this
configuration for Data Preview 1 and subsequent data releases.

#### Batch update

The prompt data products repository will be updated nightly as new data is
released from embargo.  [A script](https://github.com/lsst-dm/transfer_embargo)
copies data from the internal embargo repository to a separate public
repository.

For prompt data products, both Registry and ObsCore databases will be hosted in Postgres at USDF.  While
the Registry could be hosted in Google Cloud SQL as in the [static](#static) case, there
are technical limitations that make hosting ObsCore difficult:
* QServ is not designed for dynamic updates, so it cannot host ObsCore for a
  changing repository.
* For spatial indexing in Postgres, the ObsCore manager uses the [pg_sphere
Postgres extension](https://github.com/postgrespro/pgsphere).  This extension
is not available in Google Cloud SQL, and it is unlikely to be supported in the
future because it has few users outside of astronomy.

#### Online, immediate update

Internal Butler databases used by the Rubin project team are updated constantly
as new data arrives from the summit and as pipeline processing finishes.  The
Butler library is used to perform these updates.

We do not currently plan to use this update mode to serve data generated by the
Rubin project to end-users.  

However, there is a requirement that we provide hosting for end users to share
data products that they have created.  For [Data Preview 0.2](#dp02)
we allow end-users to write directly into the Registry database, with changes immediately visible to other users.

### Metadata Schema ("Dimension Universe")

Each Butler repository has a "Dimension Universe" defining the metadata values
that can be stored in the database, and the relationships between those values.

This "Dimension Universe" is tightly coupled to the science pipelines that
generate the data products tracked by the Butler.  It changes over time as the
pipelines evolve. As a result, different repositories will have different
universe versions.  Data Release repositories will use the version that was
current at the time the Data Release was made, while Prompt Data Products will
usually use the newest version.

## Butler database deployments

The following diagram shows the databases that will exist in mid-2025 to
support end user access to Butler data via the Rubin Science Platform:

### Data Preview 0.2
#### Summary
* Status: Deployed
* Registry: Google Cloud SQL at IDF
* ObsCore: QServ at USDF
* Update mode: Static and online user-generated

[Data Preview 0.2](https://dp0-2.lsst.io/) contains data products simulating a
portion of the LSST survey.  It is hosted on the Rubin Science Platform to
allow community science users to become familiar with LSST data products and
the tools for accessing them.

The DP0.2 Butler Registry is hosted in Postgres via Google Cloud SQL.  It
tracks approximately 250 million datasets.  The data was bulk-loaded using
Postgres's `pgrestore` utility, from a database backup generated using `pgdump`
on the database used to process the data at the USDF.

The DP0.2 data generated by the Rubin project is static, like future data
releases.  However, users are allowed to store information about their own
user-generated products in the same Registry database containing the Data
Preview data.  There are no access controls and all changes are immediately
visible to other users.

End users can access data in the Butler Registry using the Butler library, and
there are several tutorial notebooks showing how to do this.  This Butler
Registry also backs other Rubin Science Platform services like
[vo-cutouts](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/vo-cutouts) and
[datalinker](https://github.com/lsst-sqre/datalinker/), which access it
indirectly through [Butler server](https://dmtn-283.lsst.io/).

ObsCore is hosted in QServ at the USDF, sharing a database with the catalogs
generated as part of the Data Preview.  The data was exported from the Butler
registry using [dax_obscore](https://github.com/lsst-dm/dax_obscore) and
ingested into QServ.  This supports TAP queries through the Portal aspect, and
can also be accessed using other IVOA-standard TAP tools.
